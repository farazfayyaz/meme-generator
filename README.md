# Meme Generator

## Create a meme for comedic value!

This is a project I worked on to better my understanding of React.Js.
While utilizing the concepts of useState, props, and even useEffect to create useable components to display my app.

During this project I learned that forms are handled differently within React since they are updated as soon as the user interacts with the inputs.

Another lesson I learned is that API calls occurs outside the rendering of a React app and instructions must be given to encourage a API call.

My biggest take away from this project is that React web apps can be really fun and interesting to build!
